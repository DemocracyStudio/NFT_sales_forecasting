# NFT sales forecasting: hybrid approach with Computer Vision and Time Series. 
This repository gathers all the information, code and data about the NFT sales forecasting started as a group project at Machine Learning degree of [opencampus.sh](https://opencampus.sh).

### Datasets:
There are more NFTs on NFT marketplaces today than there were websites in 2010. Collecting data on NFTs implies making choices, furthermore than a feature extraction on images, our chosen approach, means heavier data manipulation and higher computational costs. Our final goal is to build a general model which could perform real-time analysis of NFT sale prediction while
